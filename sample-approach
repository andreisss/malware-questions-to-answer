MASTIFF is an static analyzer framework. It works on Linux and Mac. As a framework, the static analysis is based on plugins from the MASTIFF author and from the community.
These plugins include the following:
trid : This is used for identifying file types.
ssdeep : ssdeep is a fuzzy hash calculator. A fuzzy hash, or context triggered piecewise hashes (CTPH), can be used to identify nearly identical files.
This is useful for identifying variants of a malware family.
pdftools : A plugin by Didier Stevens. This extracts information about PDF files. exiftool : This shows info, from image files.
pefile : This shows information about PE files.
disitool : This is another Python script from Didier Stevens. This is used to extract digitalsignatures from signed executables.
pyOLEscanner : This is a tool used to extract information from OLE file types, such as Word documents and Excel spreadsheets.
