##### Common Windows API libraries

KERNEL32 -> contains base functions of Windows that are responsible for file I/O operations and memory management, including processes and threads management.
Some functions are helpers for calling more native APIs in the NTDLL library.
USER32 -> contains functions that deal with the display and graphical interface, such as program windows, menu, and icons. 
It also contains functions that controls window messages.
ADVAPI32 -> contains functions that has to do with the Windows registry.
MSVCRT -> contains standard C library functions from Microsoft Visual C++ runtime, such as printf, scanf, malloc, strlen, fopen, and getch.
WS2_32, WININET, URLMON, and NETAPI32 ->  are libraries that contain functions that have to do with networking and internet communication.
