PE executables
PE executables are programs that work on Windows. Executable files have the.exe extension. 
Dynamic link libraries uses the same PE file format and use the .dll file extension. Windows device driver programs, also in PE file format, use the .sys extension.
There are also other extensions that use the PE file format, such as screensavers (.scr).

The PE file format has a header, which is divided into the MZ header,along with its DOS stub and the PE header, followed by the data directories and section tables:

The file format follows the original MSDOS EXE format, but was extended for Windows using the PE header. If a Windows program were run in an MSDOS environment, it would
display this message: This program cannot be run in DOS mode. The code that displays this message is part of the DOS stub.
The PE header's section table contains all the information about where code and data are located in the file, and how it will be mapped into the memory when it gets loaded as a
process. The PE header contains the address where the program begins to execute code—a location known as the entry point—and will be set in the EIP register.

The data directories contain addresses of tables that, in turn, contain information such as the import table.
The import table contains the libraries and APIs that will be used by the program. 
The table follows a structure that points to a set of addresses, pointing, in turn, to the names of libraries and their respective export functions.
