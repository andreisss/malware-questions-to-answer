## BASIC STATIC ANALYSIS
#### I'll start with Static Analysis - DIE, CFF Explorerx, Peid, DIE entropy and understand if the sample is packed - go to the headers architecture, sections, timestamp created 
#### Optional headers, magic bytes important 34 64 bit. Address entry point .text (fine). Import directory also important dlls and imports functions (malware capabilities). 
#### Resource hacker - they can save .exe file to drop or .dll. 
#### like process injection - process hollowing. Or idea based on winapi call. Process32First.. FindFirstFileA..

## BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS 
#### process monitor (Process created, process closed, reg open, we can filter by name, hash, parent process) the best way is use PID as parent process.
#### Api logger ( all APIs called, (created file, delete file, rename file, move file) Inject and Log. Start to monitor the behaviour
#### Wireshark - Fakenet - save .pcap and analize it. 
#### Autoruns - persistence information like registry, scheduled tasks, processes.
