Cuckoo (open source) â€“ This tool is deployed locally. It requires a host and sandbox client(s).
The host serves as a web console to which files are submitted for analysis.
The files are executed in the sandbox, and all activities are logged and then sent back to the host server. The report can be viewed from the web console.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RegShot (free) - This tool is used to take a snapshot of the registry and file system before and after running a program. The difference between the snapshots
enables the analyst to determine what changes happened. The changes may include changes made by the operating system, and it is up to the analyst to
identify which changes were caused by the program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandboxie (freemium) - This tool is used in the environment where the program will be run. It is claimed that internally, it uses isolation technology.
In essence, the isolation technology allocates disk space, to which disk writes will only happen at the time the program is executed by Sandboxie. This enables
Sandboxie to determine changes by looking only at the isolated space.
A download link and some more information about Sandboxie can be found at https:/ / www. sandboxie. com/ HowItWorks.
Malwr (free) - This is a free online service that uses Cuckoo. Files can be submitted at https:/ / malwr. com/ .
ThreatAnalyzer (paid) - Originally known as CWSandbox, this is the most popular sandboxing technology used in the security industry for automating the
extraction of information from a piece of running malware. The technology has improved a lot, especially with its reporting. In addition, it reports descriptive
behaviors found, including a cloud query about the submitted file. It can cater to customized rules and flexible Python plugins to bring up behaviors seen by the analyst.
Payload Security's Hybrid Analysis (free) - One of the most popular free online services, like Malwr, with report contents similar to that of ThreatAnalyzer.

Process and thread monitoring
Monitoring the processes and threads, especially those that were created by the file we are analyzing, tells us that there are more behaviors occurring than is obvious.
A process can create multiple threads, which tells us that it might be doing several behaviors at the same time.
A created process tells us that a new program was just executed.
In Windows, the termination, creation, and opening of a process can be monitored by thirdparty tools such as Process Monitor.
Though there are built-in tools, such as Task Manager, that can show information about processes, some third-party tools can give more detail 
about the processes and the threads tied to it.
--------------------
Network traffic
The communicated data between a server and a client computer can only be seen during dynamic analysis. 
The packet captured during transmission will help the analyst understand what the program is sending to a server and how it will respond to any such data received.
-----------------
Popular tools, such as Wireshark and Fiddler, are used to capture packets of data and store them as pcap files. 
In Linux, the tcpdump tool is commonly used to do the same thing.
------------------
Monitoring system changes
For Windows, there are three aspects we need to monitor: memory, disk, and registry.
File monitoring tools look at created, modified, or deleted files and directories.
On the other hand, registry monitoring tools look at created, updated, or deleted registry keys, values,
and data. We can use tools such as FileMon and RegMon to do this job.
