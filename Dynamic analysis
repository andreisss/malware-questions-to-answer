Cuckoo (open source) â€“ This tool is deployed locally. It requires a host and sandbox client(s).
The host serves as a web console to which files are submitted for analysis.
The files are executed in the sandbox, and all activities are logged and then sent back to the host server. The report can be viewed from the web console.

RegShot (free) - This tool is used to take a snapshot of the registry and file system before and after running a program. The difference between the snapshots
enables the analyst to determine what changes happened. The changes may include changes made by the operating system, and it is up to the analyst to
identify which changes were caused by the program.

Sandboxie (freemium) - This tool is used in the environment where the program will be run. It is claimed that internally, it uses isolation technology.
In essence, the isolation technology allocates disk space, to which disk writes will only happen at the time the program is executed by Sandboxie. This enables
Sandboxie to determine changes by looking only at the isolated space.

Malwr (free) - This is a free online service that uses Cuckoo. Files can be submitted at https:/ / malwr. com/ .
ThreatAnalyzer (paid) - Originally known as CWSandbox, this is the most popular sandboxing technology used in the security industry for automating the
extraction of information from a piece of running malware. The technology has improved a lot, especially with its reporting. In addition, it reports descriptive
behaviors found, including a cloud query about the submitted file. It can cater to customized rules and flexible Python plugins to bring up behaviors seen by the analyst.
Payload Security's Hybrid Analysis (free) - One of the most popular free online services, like Malwr, with report contents similar to that of ThreatAnalyzer.
